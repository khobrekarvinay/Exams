version of HTML to be used by browser. Then the <html> tag that defines where the html code starts and where it ends. Inside it is the <head> tag that contains the <title> tag for setting title of the page. 
The head tag also has the style and script tags inside it if you want to use interal css styling or use javascript funcitonality in

added to the opening tag of the html element.
