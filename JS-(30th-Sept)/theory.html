Q.1 Explain the difference between primitive types and reference data types in JavaScript
-> Primitive data types are stored as raw value whereas reference data types are stored as references 
i.e pointers. Primitive data types have fixed sized, while reference have variable size. 
Primitve is passed by value, and reference is passed by reference
Primitive eg: numbers, string, undefined, boolean, null 
Reference eg: array, objects, functions and classes


Q2. Difference betwn var, let and const keywords ?
-> All three are used to declare variables. they have different scopes, hoisting, and reassign behaviours. 
Global scope: var, const
Block scope: let

var can be hoisted,  let const dont support hoisting. 
var and let can be reassigned, const cant be resassigne

Q3. How do you define a function in Javascript ? Explain the difference between function declarations and expressios.js functions
-> Functions are resusable blocks of code. They are defined using the function keyword. 
eg: function abc(params){
    //console.log(abcd);
}
In function expression u assign a function to a variable. 
const abcf= function heart(abc){

}
While in declaration you follow the original syntax mentioned above. 
Difference is declarations are of global scope whereas function expressions are scoped to the block 
they're defined in. 

Q4. Describe the concept of scope in JavaScript. What is the difference between global scope and local scope ?
-> Scope is the region or area in which a function, variable or object is defined and accessible. 
There are 3 types of scope, global scope, local scope and block scope. 

Variable declared outside any functions or block have global scope. They can be accessed anywhere in the code. 
Variables declared within a function or block have local scope. And same as before they're accessible within the function or block. 
These variables are destroyed when the function/block completes. 

Variables defined with let and const within a block have block scope. They're only accessible in the block, and then destroyed when the block ends. 

Q5. Closures: Explain closures and their use cases in JavaScript
-> In simple words a closure is a function that has access to is own scope as well as the scope of it's outer functions. 
Inner function can access and modify outer functions variables. 

Q6. How do you create objects in JavaScript ? Explain the difference between object literals and constructors.
-> You can create object in javascript by using curly braces {} or by by using the object constructor function. 
const person = {}  or const person = new Object.create({ name: 'John', age: 13 }); 

Q7. Arrays: What are the different methods to iterate over an array in JavaScript ? 
-> there are many methods that iterate over arrays in javascript each with different function. 
for loop, while loop, for of loop, for in loop, array.forEach(func), then array.filter(func), then array.reduce(func), then array.map()

Q8. this keyword: Explain how the this keyword works in different contexts (e.g., global, object methods, event handlers)
-> Mostly refers the global object, sometimes used to refers the method's object. In event listener context, this refers to the element that
triggered the event listener. 

Q9. Promises: What are promises in javascript ? explain how to use them to handle asynchronous operations. 
-> promise is a object that represents a value which may be available now, in the future, or never. They r mainly used to handle asynchronous operations.
Promises have 3 states: Pending, Fulfilled or Rejected 
Syntax: new Promise ((resolve, reject)=> (...))
Promise.resolve(value)
Promise.reject(error)

Q10. Async/Await: Explain how async/await syntax simplifies asynchronous programming in JavaScript ?
-> The async keyword used on function returns a promise and the await keyword pauses the execution of the promise until it's resolve. i.e keeps it pending. 
Any code after await runs only after Promise is resolved. 
It simplifies the Promises syntax by a lot. Helps with quicker coding and understablitily.

Q11. Explain Event loop. and how it handles asynchronous operations ?
-> Event loop is a proces thorugh which we can handle asynchronous operations to allow efficient execution of tasks. 
There are 3 parts to it
Stack: JavaScript as it is single threaded uses a stack to store function variable calls. 
Queue: Asynchronous operations are added to a queue. 
WebApi: The webApi is the browser side requests handled by the browser. Includes all asynchronous operations like fetch, settimeout.

Q12. Prototypal Inheritance: Explain prototypal inheritance in JavaScript and how it differs from classical inheritance. 
-> Both are ways to implement inheritance in JavaScript. 

Q13. Modules: How do u create and import modules in Javascript using CommonJS or ES6 modules ?
-> let's say we create a math.js file with the add function inside it then syntax for
commonJS: require('./math')
ES6: import {add} from './math.js' ;

Q14. DOM Manipulation: Explain how to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) using JavaScript.
-> 

Q15. AJAX. What is AJAX ? Explain how to make AJAX requests using Javascript. 
-> 

Q16. WebStorage. What is the difference between localStorage and sessionStorage in Javascript ?
-> Both are mechanisms for storing data locally in a user's browser. 
Localstorage stores data permanently until explicity cleared, and sessionStorage stores data temporarily for that particular session. 
sessionStorage gets cleared after the tab or browser is closed. Whereas localstorage isnt cleared after closing. 

Q17. How to use regular expressions in JavaScript for pattern matching ? 
-> 

Q18. Error Handling. How do you handle errors in JavaScript using try..catch blocks and custom error objects ? 
-> Error handling prevents application crashes, gives error messages. In javascript error handling is done by try & catch blocks
. Syntax : try {
    (code that might throw error)
}
catch(error){ 
    Handle the eror
}
Sometimes we also use the finally block, to pass code to run regarless of error
